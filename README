 Scrabble
==========

This is a scrabble clone which uses HTML5's Canvas for the UI and Django and
Eventlet for the server. The goal is to make a scrabble clone which works on
iOS, Android and desktop machines.

There currently isn't a publicly accessible server, but you can run your own
server. Make sure you have redis running, see example_project/settings.py if
you want to change the redis settings. Then you can run the following commands
to get a running server::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-pip python-dev build-essential redis-server zip # Dependencies for Ubuntu
  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/keegan_csmith/scrabble
  $ cd scrabble
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ (cd data; ./fetch_dictionaries.sh)
  $ python example_project/manage.py syncdb
  $ spawning --processes=1 --threads=0 run.application

You should now have a server running at http://localhost:8080/
